#instead of printing you can just as easily do a JSONencoder or dump straight to your output
#you could probably improve the near term quality by having a robust input set from words
#that we know are key and routinely used; do the syn/ant - but then search direct without fuzzing
#or alternately -- be focused and just do a fuzz of your keywords w/out syn/ant
